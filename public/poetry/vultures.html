   <h1>vultures</h1>
     <p>Outside the vultures circle.
     <br/>The smell of death calls them.
     <br/>Their nostrils flare in delight,
     <br/>ballpoints craning,
     <br/>bow ties ruffled in expectation.
     </p>
     <p><br/>Beside me Johnny rots.
     <br/>He died on Tuesday
     <br/>in his office chair.
     <br/>We try to ignore him:
     <br/>attention seeker
     </p>
     <p><br/>Yesterday his wife called.
     <br/>Had we seen him around lately?
     <br/>She'll pick him up tomorrow,
     <br/>schedule permitting.
     <br/>I hope she does. He's a distraction:
     <br/>I can't stand that bloody tie.
