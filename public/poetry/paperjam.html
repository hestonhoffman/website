   <h1>paper jam</h1>
     <p><i>A scream from the neighbouring cubicle</i>
     <br />I throw my crumpled paper basketball
     <br /><i>John from accounting falls from his chair</i>
     <br />The paper ball flies through my miniature hoop
     <br /><i>John is squirming on the floor now</i>
     <br />I remember what I was doing
     <br />And quickly complete the claim sheet
     <br /><i>Something is emerging from John's chest</i>
     <br /><i>It pushes up underneath his shirt</i>
     <br />I start my next claim sheet
     <br /><i>A button pops off and hits me on the head</i>
     <br /><i>John screams again</i>
     <br />"Would you keep it down!" someone shouts
     <br /><i>John is out of breath now</i>
     <br /><i>But he still flaps his hands around</i>
     <br /><i>A solid plastic corner has emerged </i>
     <br />I've made a mistake on the claim sheet
     <br /><i>A gargling hiss from John</i>
     <br /><i>Who has squirmed across the isle</i>
     <br /><i>And is holding on to my leg</i>
     <br />I white-out the mistake -
     <br />Noticing a blot of ink on my finger
     <br />Shaped almost like a butterfly
     <br />Which, after close scrutiny, I rub off 
     <br /><i>John rolls over on his back</i>
     <br /><i>A small compact printer</i>
     <br /><i>Tears itself free from his chest</i>
     <br />I'm feeling a little thirsty 
     <br /><i>The printer hops down the corridor</i>
     <br />I walk to the water-cooler
     <br /><i>The printer disappears around the corner</i>
     <br />A satisfying gargle as my paper cup is filled.</p>
