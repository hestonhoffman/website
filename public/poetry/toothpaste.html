   <h1>toothpaste man</h1>
     <p>A speck of toothpaste on his tie
     <br />removes him from the others.</p>
     <p>the speck of toothpaste
     <br />slowly grows as a result of the radiation beams from that glowing monitor
     <br />grows and slowly
     <br />grows legs and arms
     <br />and sparkling silver 
     <br />sparkling smile
     <br />leaps from the tie
     <br />dances around the room
     <br />accidentally kicking over the office manikins 
     <br />in its adaptation 
     <br />of the 'sugar plum fairies'
     <br />and then growing
     <br />and duplicating itself
     <br />until there is a toothpaste 
     <br />man behind each manikin
     <br />they act out the scenes from 
     <br />the latest Broadway show
     <br />here lifting plastic arms
     <br />or thumping plastic chests
     <br />until they grow tired 
     <br />and a sudden realisation
     <br />whispers dry air from 
     <br />a long opened window
     <br />nothing stirs 
     <br />but only parches manikin throats
     <br />and freezes each 
     <br />slowly 
     <br />in mid yawn</p>
