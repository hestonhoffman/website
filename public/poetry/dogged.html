   <h1>dogged</h1>
     <p>Watching his legs twitch,
     <br />I realise that Rover is having that same dream again:
     <br />the one in which he is wearing a suit and tie
     <br />like some backwards leash
     <br />and that he is standing at that infernal 
     <br />water-cooler
     <br />on his hind legs,
     <br />when a familiar smell wafts in
     <br />from a distant cubicle,
     <br />of far too much perfume,
     <br />and a feint rumble beneath his paws
     <br />suggests that Deloris is approaching,
     <br />and that soon
     <br />he will be forced to make small-talk
     <br />while trying to avoid her
     <br />sweaty armpit patches.</p>
